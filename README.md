This repository consists of the following directories:
- R_codes : codes used to make the figures that appear in the paper
- general_model_mscommands : ms commands (Hudson 2002) corresponding to the general structured tree model shown in Figure 7 of the paper for different values of splitting times
- simulated_genomic_stats : scripts used to computed the genetic diversity and the genetic differentiation of the genomic simulated data (simulated with ms using the ms commands mentioned above)
- snif_inference : parameter files used to run SNIF (Arredondo et al. 2021) on the empirical PSMC curves of chimpanzees (curves retrieved from Prado Martinez et al. 2013)
- snif_validationstep: parameter files used to run SNIF on the simulated T2 and simulated PSMC under the inferred models
