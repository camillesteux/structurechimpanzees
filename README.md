This repository consists of:
- admixture: parameter files, model and scripts to reproduce the admixture analysis
- general_model_mscommands: ms commands and .yaml files of the general structured tree model (Figure 7 of the paper)
- general_model_withsubspmig_mscommands: ms commands of the general structured tree model with migration between subspecies (Figure S1 of the Supplementary Material)
- simulated_genomic_stats: scripts used to compute genomic statistics on our simulated genomic data
- snif_inference: parameter and output files of SNIF analysis + .yaml files of the inferred subspecies scenarios used for the validation step and to build the general structured tree model
- snif_validationstep: parameter files used for the "validation step" analysis
